### **PROJECT EXPERIENCE**

#### **Clothes Searching with Deep Network**
October, 2014: This project aims to help users to find similar clothes or bags on the e-commerce websites with their reference photoes. We conduct a clothes/bags detection on the crawled data and train our deep Convolution Neural Network(CNN) based on the clothes context infomations for image search.


#### **Emerging Topic Detection on SYSU Community**
Spring Semester, 2013: In the project, we crawled 2.6 million tweets of 8000 SYSUers in Sina Weibo. By modeling the content lifecycle and energy of each word, we found out the popular events in the SYSU community in Sina Weibo and tracked the trends.


#### **Beauty Minng in Sina Weibo**
Fall Semester, 2012: In this project, we dig out the beauties who are within n weibo relationship chains of the user. Beauty is judged by observing the features of her weibo infomation and using Native Bayesian classifier to do emotional analysis on their tweetContents and



### **RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

#### **Gradient Boosting Based Semi-Supervised Asymmetry Hashing**
We design a new learning to hash model motivated by the asymmetry hashing for shorted code. Given the affinity matrix S, we conduct a matrix fatorization process using Gradient Boosting in order to utilize available auxiliary information to improve prediction accuracy. Besides, we also use an ITQ process to minimize the quantization error of the matrix fatorization result.


### **AWARD**
+ SYSU Outstanding Students Fisrt-class Scholarship (Nov., 2011)
+ SYSU Outstanding Students Second-class Scholarship (Nov., 2012)
+ Second Prize of SYSU International Collegiate Programming Contest (Apr., 2013)
